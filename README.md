## File Transfer Peer To Peer

Welcome to the File Transfer Peer to Peer project!  It is currently a prototype, or in pre-alpha (as we like to say).

##Requirements/Installation 

This project is written purely in javascript, so you'll need to install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), and a few other specific packages to get started.  

You can install both with:

`curl -L http://git.io/n-install | bash -s -- -y latest`

Then all you'll need to do is run:

`npm install` from the root directory of this repository!

If you want feel free to use [our laptop script](https://github.com/18F/laptop) which comes with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
